# Build via Rojo

Head on over to the [Portal Github Releases](https://www.github.com/ShaneButt/Portal/releases/), and download the latest build. You will need to have [Rojo 7.0](https://rojo.space/) installed.

- Download either the zip file or the `.rbxm` file from the releases above into a common directory for quick access,
- Copy these files into your Rojo-project, inside your ReplicatedStorage folder,
- Ensure your Rojo project JSON file is tracking the folder or the file(s)!

# Insert File via Studio

Again, you will need to go to the latest release, however, you must install the `rbxm` file, from there, open your project in Roblox Studio, then insert the Portal `rbxm` into ReplicatedStorage:

- Download the `rbxm` file from the release page above into a common directory for quick access,
- Open your project/experience in Roblox Studio
- Right-click on ReplicatedStorage, or a folder within of your choosing, and select "Insert into from file...",
- Select and insert the "portal.rbxm" file,
- A new ModuleScript named "Portal" should now be inserted into your project!
